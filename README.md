Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.6.3.

Project Motivation

I'm doing a course on how to use git and GitHub. Part of this course is to create my first repository on GitHub and do some commits.

File Descriptions

This repo contains five files:

index.html
README.md
.gitignore
js
css 

Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
